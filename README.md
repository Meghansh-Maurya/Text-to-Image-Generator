This code creates a user-friendly image generator using the **Stable Diffusion v1.5** model. It's built with the **Diffusers** library from Hugging Face for the model and **Gradio** to create a simple web-based interface. The application automatically detects and utilizes a **GPU** for faster performance and falls back to a CPU if a GPU isn't available.

### Key Components

* **`StableDiffusionPipeline`:** This is the core component from the `diffusers` library. It loads the Stable Diffusion model, handling all the complex processes of text-to-image generation. The `torch_dtype` is set to `torch.float16` for GPUs, which makes the process much faster.
* **`gradio`:** This library is used to build the user interface. It takes the `generate_image` function, automatically creates a text box for the user to input a prompt, and a display area to show the generated image.
* **`huggingface_hub`:** This library is used to log in to your Hugging Face account, which is necessary to download the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model weights.
